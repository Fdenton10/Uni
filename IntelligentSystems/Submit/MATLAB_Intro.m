% Introduction to Matlab Webinar
%
% Observations - Follow Along
%  Deliverables
% - Report
% - Model used to create predictions
% - Interactive Application
%
% What is Matlab?
% - High-Level Language
% - Interactive Development Environment
% 
% Matlab Interface
% - Command Window - Enter and Run commands, creating variables in the
%   workspace.
% - Displays current file directory
% - Toolbars at top.
%
% Techinical Computing Workflow
% - Access -> Explore and Discover -> Share (Documentation, Application, Report)
% Key theme Automation
%
% Demo - Fuel Economy Analysis
% Importing csv files, creating variables automatically based on inputted
% data. Imported as Table Data.
% Script Generation 
% Function Generations - Takes input and gives output. 
% Can view and plot individual columns and rows of data against eachother
% to see comparisons between them and the correlation between them.
% Can get summarys of individual columns and rows.
% Edit the plot by adding keys, creating x, y axis labels. Can generate
% code for plots to easily recreate.
%
% Creates a script using specific functions to easily reapply them at a
% later date.
%
% Indexing Data in specific columns to only output the specific data you
% might need or be working with. Logical Indexing. Use of And, Or operators
%
% Can search for functions, right click to view in order to familiarise
% users with new functions or similar ones. And display the meaning of each
% part of the function. Matlab Documentation Page, displays syntax,
% description and options you can pass. With examples.
%
% Plot - Curve fitting, box plots, histograms, many different views of data
% available.
%
% Publish table - Combines all figures and plots created into an automated
% report, snapshotting every section and piecing them together. 
%
% Create Application - Allowing someone to do similar work to what was
% created.
% New - GUI - Allows to lay out User Interface for Application.
% When publishing - Analysise the app to make sure everything needed to run
% is there. Can share with others. Matlab users simple.
% Non- Matlab users, change it to a stand-alone executable and then send to
% desired recipient.
%
% Summary
% - Accessing Data from files, web data 
% - Can talk to other languages and data bases (C/C++ etc)
% - Extensive Plotting Capabilities
% - Built-in Engineering and Mathematical Functions
% - Generate Reports
% - Package as app or deploy to other environments.
